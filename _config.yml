          Is critical input information encoded in specific sparse pathways within the neural network? In this work, we discuss the problem of identifying these critical pathways and subsequently leverage them for interpreting the network's response to an input. The pruning objective -- selecting the smallest group of neurons for which the response remains equivalent to the original network -- has been previously proposed for identifying critical pathways. We demonstrate that sparse pathways derived from pruning do not necessarily encode critical input information. To ensure sparse pathways include critical fragments of the encoded input information, we propose pathway selection via neurons' contribution to the response. We proceed to explain how critical pathways can reveal critical input features. We prove that pathways selected via neuron contribution are locally linear (in an L2-ball), a property that we use for proposing a feature attribution method: "pathway gradient". We validate our interpretation method using mainstream evaluation experiments. The validation of pathway gradient interpretation method further confirms that selected pathways using neuron contributions correspond to critical input features.

          Unsupervised representation learning has proved to be a critical component of anomaly detection/localization in images. The challenges to learn such a representation are two-fold. Firstly, the sample size is not often large enough to learn a rich generalizable representation through conventional techniques. Secondly, while only normal samples are available at training, the learned features should be discriminative of normal and anomalous samples. Here, we propose to use the "distillation" of features at various layers of an expert network, pre-trained on ImageNet, into a simpler cloner network to tackle both issues. We detect and localize anomalies using the discrepancy between the expert and cloner networks' intermediate activation values given the input data. We show that considering multiple intermediate hints in distillation leads to better exploiting the expert's knowledge and more distinctive discrepancy compared to solely utilizing the last layer activation values. Notably, previous methods either fail in precise anomaly localization or need expensive region-based training. In contrast, with no need for any special or intensive training procedure, we incorporate interpretability algorithms in our novel framework for the localization of anomalous regions.

        title: Rethinking Positive Aggregation and Propagation of Gradients in Gradient-based Saliency Methods

          Saliency methods interpret the prediction of a neural network by showing the importance of input elements for that prediction. A popular family of saliency methods utilize gradient information. In this work, we empirically show that two approaches for handling the gradient information, namely positive aggregation, and positive propagation, break these methods. Though these methods reflect visually salient information in the input, they do not explain the model prediction anymore as the generated saliency maps are insensitive to the predicted output and are insensitive to model parameter randomization. Specifically for methods that aggregate the gradients of a chosen layer such as GradCAM++ and FullGrad, exclusively aggregating positive gradients is detrimental. We further support this by proposing several variants of aggregation methods with positive handling of gradient information. For methods that backpropagate gradient information such as LRP, RectGrad, and Guided Backpropagation, we show the destructive effect of exclusively propagating positive gradient information.
