          Is critical input information encoded in specific sparse pathways within the neural network? In this work, we discuss the problem of identifying these critical pathways and subsequently 
          leverage them for interpreting the network's response to an input. We demonstrate that sparse pathways derived from pruning do not necessarily encode critical input information. <span id="dots_1">...</span><span id="more_1" style="display:none">The pruning objective -- selecting the smallest group of neurons for which the response remains equivalent to the 
          original network -- has been previously proposed for identifying critical pathways. As stated, using pruning objective is flawed for obtaining pathways encoding critical input information.
          To ensure sparse pathways include critical fragments of the encoded input information, we propose pathway selection via neurons' contribution to the response. We proceed to explain how critical pathways can 
          reveal critical input features. We prove that pathways selected via neuron contribution are locally linear (in an L2-ball), a property that we use for 
          proposing a feature attribution method: "pathway gradient". We validate our interpretation method using mainstream evaluation experiments. The validation of pathway gradient interpretation method further confirms 
          that selected pathways using neuron contributions correspond to critical input features.</span>

          Here, we propose to use the “distillation” of features at various layers of an expert network, which is pre-trained on ImageNet, into a simpler cloner network to tackle issues in
          unsupervised representation learning for anomaly detection/localization. 
          We detect and localize anomalies using the discrepancy between the expert and cloner networks’ intermediate activation values given an input sample. <span id="dots_2">...</span><span id="more_2" style="display:none">
          Unsupervised representation learning has proved to be a critical component of anomaly detection/localization in images. 
          The challenges to learn such a representation are two-fold. Firstly, the sample size is not often large enough to learn a rich generalizable representation through 
          conventional techniques. Secondly, while only normal samples are available at training, the learned features should be discriminative of normal and anomalous samples. 
          Here, we propose to use the “distillation” of features at various layers of an expert network, which is pre-trained on ImageNet, into a simpler cloner network to tackle both issues. 
          We detect and localize anomalies using the discrepancy between the expert and cloner networks’ intermediate activation values given an input sample. 
          We show that considering multiple intermediate hints in distillation leads to better exploitation of the expert’s knowledge and a more distinctive discrepancy between the two networks, 
          compared to utilizing only the last layer activation values. Notably, previous methods either fail in precise anomaly localization or need expensive region-based training. In contrast, 
          with no need for any special or intensive training procedure, we incorporate interpretability algorithms in our novel framework to localize anomalous regions. 
          Despite the striking difference between some test datasets and ImageNet, we achieve competitive or significantly superior results compared to SOTA on MNIST, F-MNIST, CIFAR-10, MVTecAD, Retinal-OCT, 
          and two other medical datasets on both anomaly detection and localization.</span>

          The black-box nature of CNNs has sparked many recent works to explain the prediction via 
          input feature attribution methods. However, input these methods merely identify the importance of input regions for the prediction and lack semantic interpretation 
          of model behavior. Here, we first identify the semantics associated with internal units (feature maps) of the network. We proceed to investigate the following questions; <span id="dots_3">...</span><span id="more_3" style="display:none">Does a regression model 
          that is only trained with COVID-19 severity scores implicitly learn visual patterns associated with thoracic pathologies? 
          Does a network that is trained on weakly labeled data (e.g. healthy, unhealthy) 
          implicitly learn pathologies? Moreover, we investigate the effect of pretraining and data imbalance on the interpretability of learned features. 
          In addition to the analysis, we propose semantic attribution to semantically explain each prediction. 
          We present our findings using publicly available chest pathologies (CheXpert, NIH ChestX-ray8) 
          and COVID-19 datasets (BrixIA, and COVID-19 chest X-ray segmentation dataset).</span>

        title: Rethinking Positive Aggregation and Propagation of Gradients in Gradient-based Saliency Methods

          A popular family of saliency methods utilize gradient information. 
          In this work, we empirically show that two approaches for handling the gradient information, namely positive aggregation, and positive propagation, 
          (e.g. in methods like GradCAM++ and FullGrad)
          break these methods. Though these methods reflect visually salient information in the input, they do not explain the model prediction 
          anymore <span id="dots_4">...</span><span id="more_4" style="display:none">as the generated saliency maps are insensitive to the predicted output and are insensitive to model parameter 
          randomization. Specifically for methods that aggregate the gradients of a chosen layer such as GradCAM++ and FullGrad, exclusively aggregating positive gradients is detrimental. 
          We further support this by proposing several variants of aggregation methods with positive handling of gradient information. 
          For methods that backpropagate gradient information such as LRP, RectGrad, and Guided Backpropagation, we show the destructive effect of 
          exclusively propagating positive gradient information.</span>

      #  title: Improving Feature Attribution through Input-specific Network Pruning
      #  image: /images/pruning.jpg 
      #  description: |
      #    Attributing the output of a neural network to the contribution of given input elements is a way of shedding light on the black-box nature of neural networks. Due to the complexity of current network architectures, current gradient-based attribution methods provide very noisy or coarse results. We propose to prune a neural network for a given single input to keep only neurons that highly contribute to the prediction. We show that by input-specific pruning, network gradients change from reflecting local (noisy) importance information to global importance. Our proposed method is efficient and generates fine-grained attribution maps. We further provide a theoretical justification of the pruning approach relating it to perturbations and validate it through a novel experimental setup. Our method is evaluated by multiple benchmarks: sanity checks, pixel perturbation, and Remove-and-Retrain (ROAR). These benchmarks evaluate the method from different perspectives and our method performs better than other methods across all evaluations.
